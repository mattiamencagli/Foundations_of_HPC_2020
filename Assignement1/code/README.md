# Assignment 1

## Section 1

I use a Python script (perf_mod.ipynb) to compute the algorithm and to generate the csv file and the plots presented in the report.

## Section 2

I modify "mpi_pi.c" in "my_mpi.c", here I change the way the program print the output: I pass all the final times of each processor to the master that have to print all of it.
In this way the output is much more simple to be read by the Python script that I write to generate the csv files and the plots presented in the report.
